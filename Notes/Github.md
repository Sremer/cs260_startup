# Github

## Creating and cloning a repo

- It is often easier to create a repo first on GitHub then clone it
- Copy the URL Github gives you and with that, you can clone the repo to your own machine

## Making Changes

- You need to commit changes after making them
- You need to push the changes to change the repo in GitHub
- You can pull the changes down to your computer to have the changes made in GItHub

## Handling Merge Conflicts

- You need to remove the conflicts and modify the file to keep the changes we want
- Our file will contain what we want from both commits

## Forks

- We can make a copy of anyone's repo on Github and we can edit our own version and even push our changes that can be used by the original repo owner if desired
