###DNS

##What is it?
A domain name can be bought and listed with an associated IP address

##Database Records
- A (address) maps straight from domain name to IP address
- CNAME maps one domain name to another and acts as an alias
- Every DNS server references special DNS servers called authoritative name servers

Cache
- You can set the time to live(TTL) so it can clear the cache after the requested period has passed
