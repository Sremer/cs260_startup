### Elevator pitch
Have you ever wanted to test how well you know a song's lyrics or see which one of your friends knows a song the best? The *insert name* application lets you race against the clock and against your friends to see how fast you can type out a song's lyrics. You can race your friends in real time and can even see your past scores. You will be able to pick any song and what percentage of the song you want to type.
